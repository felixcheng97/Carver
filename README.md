# Benchmarking and Analyzing 3D-aware Image Synthesis with a Modularized Codebase

![timeline.jpg](figures/3D_benchmark.jpg)
Figure: Overview of our modularized pipeline for 3D-aware image synthesis, which modularizes the 
generation process in a universal way. Each module can be improved independently, 
facilitating algorithm development. Note that the discriminator is omitted for simplicity.
